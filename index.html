    <p class="para 1">Subhas Chandra Bose 23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945[4][5]) was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British
        authority in India made him a hero among Indians,[h][i][j] but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and
        Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism,[16][k][l][m][n] anti-Semitism,[o][p][q][23] and military
        failure.[r][26][27][s][t] The honorific Netaji (Hindustani: "Respected Leader") was first applied to Bose in
        Germany in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in
        the Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used throughout India.[u]

        Subhas Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during the British Raj. The
        early recipient of an Anglocentric education, he was sent after college to England to take the Indian Civil
        Service examination. He succeeded with distinction in the vital first exam but demurred at taking the routine
        final exam, citing nationalism to be a higher calling. Returning to India in 1921, Bose joined the nationalist
        movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a
        group within the Congress which was less keen on constitutional reform and more open to socialism.[v] Bose
        became Congress president in 1938. After reelection in 1939, differences arose between him and the Congress
        leaders, including Gandhi, over the future federation of British India and princely states, but also because
        discomfort had grown among the Congress leadership over Bose's negotiable attitude to non-violence, and his
        plans for greater powers for himself.[32] After the large majority of the Congress Working Committee members
        resigned in protest,[33] Bose resigned as president and was eventually ousted from the party.[34][35][36]</p>

    <p class="secondpara">In April 1941 Bose arrived in Nazi Germany, where the leadership offered unexpected but
        equivocal sympathy for India's independence.[37][38] German funds were employed to open a Free India Centre in
        Berlin. A 3,000-strong Free India Legion was recruited from among Indian POWs captured by Erwin Rommel's Afrika
        Korps to serve under Bose.[39][w] Although peripheral to their main goals, the Germans inconclusively considered
        a land invasion of India throughout 1941. By the spring of 1942, the German army was mired in Russia and Bose
        became keen to move to southeast Asia, where Japan had just won quick victories.[41] Adolf Hitler during his
        only meeting with Bose in late May 1942 offered to arrange a submarine.[42] During this time, Bose became a
        father; his wife,[6][x] or companion,[43][y] Emilie Schenkl, gave birth to a baby girl.[6][z][37] Identifying
        strongly with the Axis powers, Bose boarded a German submarine in February 1943.[44][45] Off Madagascar, he was
        transferred to a Japanese submarine from which he disembarked in Japanese-held Sumatra in May 1943.[44]

        With Japanese support, Bose revamped the Indian National Army (INA), which comprised Indian prisoners of war of
        the Indian Army who had been captured by the Japanese in the Battle of Singapore.[46][47][48] A Provisional
        Government of Free India was declared on the Japanese-occupied Andaman and Nicobar Islands and was nominally
        presided by Bose.[49][2][aa] Although Bose was unusually driven and charismatic, the Japanese considered him to
        be militarily unskilled,[ab] and his soldierly effort was short-lived. In late 1944 and early 1945, the Indian
        Army reversed the Japanese attack on India. Almost half the Japanese forces and the participating INA contingent
        were killed.[ac][ad] The remaining INA was driven down the Malay Peninsula and surrendered with the recapture of
        Singapore. Bose chose to escape to Manchuria to seek a future in the Soviet Union which he believed to have
        turned anti-British. He died from third-degree burns received when his overloaded plane crashed in Japanese
        Taiwan on August 18, 1945.[ae] Some Indians did not believe that the crash had occurred,[af] expecting Bose to
        return to secure India's independence.[ag][ah][ai] The Indian National Congress, the main instrument of Indian
        nationalism, praised Bose's patriotism but distanced itself from his tactics and ideology.[aj][57] The British
        Raj, never seriously threatened by the INA,[ak][al] charged 300 INA officers with treason in the INA trials, but
        eventually backtracked in the face of opposition by the Congress,[am] and a new mood in Britain for rapid
        decolonisation in India.[an][57][13] Bose's legacy is mixed. Among many in India, he is the muscular hero, his
        saga serving as a would-be counterpoise to the many actions of regeneration, negotiation, and reconciliation
        over a quarter-century through which the independence of India was achieved.[ao][ap][aq] His collaborations with
        Japanese Fascism and Nazism pose serious ethical dilemmas,[ar] especially his reluctance to publicly criticize
        the worst excesses of German anti-Semitism from 1938 onwards or to offer refuge in India to its
        victims.[as][at][au]</p>
